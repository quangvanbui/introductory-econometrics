# ETC2410 Introductory Econometrics

### An empirical analysis of relationships between economic variables

Chief Examiner: Prof. Farshid Vahid-Araghi 

## Introduction
One of the first subjects I taught as a teaching associate was for Monash University's Introductory Econometrics, a second year undergraduate course that covers the fundamentals of econometrics using EViews. Of the many important tips for first-time TAs, perhaps the most important was to be well-prepared before class (there is no substitute for preparation and I would even go as far as saying that first-time TAs should be over-prepared before class). A by-product of my personal preparation were tutorial notes that eventually became a core component of my tutorial delivery. This repository contains all my notes for ETC2410, which were refined over five semesters of teaching (2016 - 2018).

## Who should use these notes?
These notes are designed for beginners. Though it is helpful to have a basic understanding of statistics, no knowledge of any statistical concept is assumed. It covers introductory concepts in econometrics including ordinary least squares, linear regression, hypothesis testing, heteroskedasticity and basic time-series modelling. Students taking ETC2410 and first-time TAs may benefit most.
